I’m [**Akhil**](https://akhi1-s.github.io/akhi1-s-akhil.github.io/), a Robotics & AI Systems Engineer obsessed with crafting autonomous minds and predator-grade machines.

I don’t code bots.  
I train instincts.

🧠 Robotics | 🦖 Autonomy | 🐍 NLP  
Currently: Building at **Zeo ** — on a mission to make humanoids child-safe and emotionally aware.

#### 🔍 About Me
- 🦖 Simulating predators, not followers.  
- 🧠 ROS2 | Gazebo | Sensor Fusion | Embedded AI  
- 🛠️ Writing logic for machines that make decisions, not excuses.
- 🐍 Crushing bugs, feeding snakes.  
- 🌱 Debugging with cats. Growing code and plants in silence.

#### 💡 Fun Facts
- I don’t chase trends — I architect futures.  
- Coffee powers some. I run on purpose.  
- I’d pick *Steins;Gate*, *Psycho-Pass*, *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*, or *Erased* over Netflix any day.  
- My cats are more emotionally aware than half the bots online.  
- Gardening clears my cache.
